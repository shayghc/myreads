# MyReads App

This repo contains the code for the MyReads book reading project for the React portion of the Udacity FEND course. The app tracks your reading history (with the library contained in the provided API).

Built on top of the [starter template](https://github.com/udacity/reactnd-project-myreads-starter). 

## Quickstart :point_left:

1. Clone the repo
2. cd into the project root and run `npm install`
3. run `npm start` to activate the server.

If you follow those steps the app should open in your default browser.

## Important

The backend API uses a fixed set of cached search results and is limited to a particular set of search terms, which can be found in [SEARCH_TERMS.md](SEARCH_TERMS.md). That list of terms are the _only_ terms that will work with the backend, so don't be surprised if your searches for Basket Weaving or Bubble Wrap don't come back with any results.
